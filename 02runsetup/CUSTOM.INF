;this section is automatically loaded and the copyfiles sections named in it are executed during the precopy phase.
; normally it's used to copy driver infs to the temporary setup directory
; since the registry doesn't exist during the precopy phase of setup, I doubt you can do much of anything else with it

; I have played with this section a little - you can use it to copy any files anywhere, not just infs.
; I haven't tried putting an "addreg" section here, since msbatch.inf works just fine for doing addreg stuff.

;I once tried compressing the driver infs into a cab. I ran into problems,
;but I think it was because I had made a mistake somewhere.
